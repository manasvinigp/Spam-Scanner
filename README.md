# Spam Scanner - AI-Enhanced Cybersecurity Solution for Threat Detection and Prevention

Our AI-enhanced cybersecurity solution, Spam Scanner, provides advanced threat detection and prevention capabilities to protect you. **Our AI-enhanced solution helps you safeguard yourself from malicious actors online.**

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and use the Spam Scanner extension:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone or download the entire repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone <repo_url>
```

### Step 2: Install All Dependencies

Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install all the required dependencies.

```bash
pip install tld
pip install joblib
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install scikit-learn
pip install requests
pip install groq
```

For the Node.js dependencies, run:

```bash
npm install express cors axios body-parser child-process module
```

### Step 3: Run the Server

Open `index.js` in your code editor (preferably VS Code) and run the `index.js` file using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

If you have `nodemon` installed, you can also use:

```bash
nodemon index.js
```

This allows you to dynamically observe any changes made to the code.

## Usage

Once the server is running, your Spam Scanner will be an operational web extension, providing real-time threat detection and prevention for you. We integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) to chunk text, identifying potential malware or phishing messages. Groq API further analyzes data in the form of chunks for insights. Additionally, Mixtral LLM generates comprehensive reports summarizing website contents, providing critical intelligence for threat detection and prevention. 
This requires groq API key **We have included our API keys for testing purposes, which will be removed shortly.**
